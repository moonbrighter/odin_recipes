# odin_recipes
A project from the Foundations Course of theodinproject.com. This project is to develop my foundational HTML and CSS skills.

What I learned:
- the paragraph content fills the webpage's entire width
- I can add nested lists
- that paragraphs and images stack vertically by default, whereas some other elements allow new content to sit beside them on the same line

    <p>Spanakopita is perhaps the most famous savory Greek pastry, beloved for its shattering, golden crust and rich, salty filling. It is a staple snack or light meal found in every bakery across Greece.</p>

    <p>The magic of this dish lies in the contrast between the paper-thin layers of buttery phyllo dough and the moist, herbaceous interior. The filling combines earthy spinach with the sharp tang of Feta cheese, bound together by eggs.</p>

    <p>While often sold as handheld triangles, this casserole version is easier to make at home and perfect for feeding a crowd, delivering that iconic crunch in every bite.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><h3>The Filling</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Spinach: 16 oz frozen chopped spinach (thawed and squeezed dry) or 2 lbs fresh</li>
          <li>Cheese: 10 oz crumbled Feta cheese and 1/2 cup ricotta (optional for creaminess)</li>
          <li>Aromatics: 1 bunch green onions (chopped) and 2 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
          <li>Fresh Herbs: 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley and 1/4 cup fresh dill</li>
          <li>Binder: 2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
          <li>Seasoning: Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><h3>The Crust</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Phyllo Dough: 1 package (16 oz) #4 thickness, thawed</li>
          <li>Fat: 1 cup unsalted butter (melted) or olive oil</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Phase 1: Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Dry the Spinach:</strong> If using frozen spinach, squeeze it thoroughly in a kitchen towel to remove excess water. If using fresh, sauté until wilted, then squeeze dry.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mix Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the spinach, green onions, garlic, parsley, dill, feta, ricotta, and eggs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Season:</strong> Add pepper and a small amount of salt (be careful, as Feta is already salty). Mix until well combined.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Phase 2: Assemble the Layers</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prep the Pan:</strong> Brush a 9x13 inch baking dish with melted butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bottom Crust:</strong> Unroll the phyllo dough. Place one sheet in the dish and brush with butter. Repeat this with about 10–12 sheets for the bottom layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add Filling:</strong> Spread the spinach and cheese mixture evenly over the bottom phyllo stack.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Top Crust:</strong> Layer the remaining phyllo sheets over the filling, brushing each individual sheet with butter as you go.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Phase 3: Bake and Serve</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Score:</strong> Before baking, use a sharp knife to cut the top layers into squares or diamonds (do not cut all the way to the bottom). This prevents the pastry from crumbling later.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake:</strong> Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 45–50 minutes, or until the phyllo is deeply golden brown and crisp.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cool:</strong> Let it sit for 15 minutes before finishing the cuts and serving.
      </li>
    </ol>

      <h1>Moussaka: The Iconic Taste of Greece</h1>
      <img class="recipe-img" src="../images/moussaka.jpg" alt="A photo of a Moussaka" width="500">
      <p>Moussaka is often described as the Mediterranean's answer to Shepherd’s Pie or Lasagna, but with a complex, aromatic twist. At its heart, it is a rich, baked casserole built on layers of tender roasted eggplant (and often potato), topped with a savory lamb or beef ragu.</p>

      <p>What truly sets Moussaka apart is the flavor profile of the meat sauce—deeply seasoned with cinnamon, allspice, and red wine—and the crowning layer of silky, golden-brown Béchamel. Because the sauce is thickened with eggs and cheese, it bakes into a custard-like topping that holds its shape beautifully.</p>

      <p>The result is a decadent, "comfort-food" masterpiece that balances the earthiness of the vegetables with the warmth of the spices and the creamy indulgence of the sauce.</p>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <h3>Phase 1: Prepare the Vegetables</h3>
      <ol class="phase">
        <li>
          <span class="step-title"><strong>Prep the Eggplant:</strong></span>
          Slice the eggplants into rounds. Sprinkle with salt and let them sit in a colander for 30 minutes to draw out moisture. Rinse and pat them thoroughly dry.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="step-title"><strong>Cook the Base:</strong></span>
          Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Brush the eggplant and potato slices with olive oil and arrange them on baking sheets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="step-title"><strong>Roast:</strong></span>
          Bake for about 15–20 minutes until soft and slightly golden. Set aside. (Note: The potatoes usually take a few minutes longer than the eggplants).
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Phase 2: Make the Meat Sauce</h3>
      <ol class="phase">
        <li>
          <span class="step-title"><strong>Sauté Aromatics:</strong></span> In a large pan, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Sauté the onion until translucent, then add the garlic for 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="step-title"><strong>Brown the Meat:</strong></span> Add the ground lamb/beef. Break it up with a spoon and cook until browned.
          Drain any excess fat.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="step-title"><strong>Simmer:</strong></span> Stir in the tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, wine, broth, cinnamon, allspice, and oregano.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="step-title"><strong>Reduce:</strong></span> Lower the heat and simmer for 20–30 minutes until the sauce is thick and the liquid has mostly evaporated. Stir in fresh parsley at the end.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Phase 3: The Béchamel "Custard"</h3>
      <ol class="phase">
        <li>
          <span class="step-title"><strong>Make the Roux:</strong></span> Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 2 minutes (don't let it brown).
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="step-title"><strong>Add Milk:</strong></span> Slowly pour in the warm milk while whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Simmer until the sauce thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="step-title"><strong>Temper the Eggs:</strong></span> Remove from heat. Whisk a small amount of the hot sauce into your beaten eggs (to avoid scrambling them), then pour the egg mixture back into the main pot.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="step-title"><strong>Finish:</strong></span> Stir in the nutmeg and half of your grated cheese.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h1>Horiatiki: The Authentic Greek Salad</h1>
      <img class="recipe-img" src="../images/horiatiki.jpg" alt="A photo of Horiatiki Salad" width="500">

      <p>Horiatiki, which translates to "Village Salad," is a rustic summer staple that highlights the quality of fresh produce. Unlike many Western versions, an authentic Greek salad contains absolutely no lettuce or fillers.</p>

      <p>It relies entirely on the crunch of cucumbers, the juice of ripe tomatoes, and the sharpness of onions and peppers. The crowning glory is a large slab of Feta cheese placed right on top, rather than crumbled into the mix.</p>

      <p>This dish is simple, healthy, and refreshing, dressed only with high-quality olive oil and oregano to let the natural flavors shine.</p>

      </ol>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <h3>Phase 1: Prepare the Vegetables</h3>
      <ol class="phase">
        <li>
          <span class="step-title"><strong>Chop Tomatoes:</strong></span> Cut the tomatoes into large, bite-sized wedges. Place them in a large serving bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="step-title"><strong>Slice Veggies:</strong></span> Add the sliced cucumbers and green peppers to the bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="step-title"><strong>Soak Onions:</strong></span> (Optional) If the red onions are too sharp, soak them in ice water for 5 minutes, then drain before adding to the salad.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Phase 2: Assemble the Salad</h3>
      <ol class="phase">
        <li>
          <span class="step-title"><strong>Combine:</strong></span> Toss the tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, onions, and olives gently to mix them without crushing the tomatoes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="step-title"><strong>Add the Slab:</strong></span> Place the large block of Feta cheese directly on top of the vegetables.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Phase 3: Dress and Serve</h3>
      <ol class="phase">
        <li>
          <span class="step-title"><strong>Season:</strong></span> Sprinkle a generous amount of dried oregano over the feta and the vegetables. Add a pinch of sea salt (mainly on the tomatoes).
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="step-title"><strong>Pour Oil:</strong></span> Drizzle the extra virgin olive oil generously over everything. Add the vinegar if you prefer a tangy kick.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="step-title"><strong>Serve:</strong></span> Serve immediately with crusty bread to soak up the juices (the "papara") left at the bottom of the bowl.
        </li>
      </ol>
